## Introduction

**Yawn** is our type-safe wrapper over Hibernate. It allows us to write queries in a fully type-safe, code-complete-ready manner. No more nasty strings,
unchecked types and runtime bugs.

```kotlin
transactor.callPrimaryReadOnly {
  val theHobbit = yawn.query(BookTable) { books ->
    addEq(books.name, "The Hobbit")
  }.uniqueResult()!!

  assertThat(theHobbit.token.id).isEqualTo("b_2")
  assertThat(theHobbit.author).isEqualTo("J.R.R. Tolkien")
}
```

This is what it looks like:
